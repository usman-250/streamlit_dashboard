He started working as shop keeper, a small cabin on the main street of the village, and on/off worked as a daily wager with local farmers. After 10 years  When I (his only son) was 14, I started to insist in front of him to not work and let me take responsibility of the home.  I was not able to see him working in such hard conditions with a full white beard. He then told me \"Look son, I am working in my 70s so that you do not have an excuse to quit education.\" These words of him still echos in my ear and I am not able to rest a full night. Whenever I waste an hour it reminds me of his efforts and works for my success. He worked when others were planning retirement. He worked in June & July, under the skin burning sun, cold nights, and rains. He wanted to see his son, the first family member, to be graduated. It was 3 years before in 2018 when I graduated from FAST NUCES. He was so happy to see me wearing a cap and gown. And I was happy to see him smiling. It was the first time in a decade when we were so much happy as the whole world had been conquered. They say there is women behind every successful man, it may be true in their case but I am heard rephrasing it  \"There is a man behind my success.\". And I am missing him badly today.PS:My mother was a strong mother. She also struggled a lot, a long side my father in this journey. They both paired up in a battle where they wanted to succeed their only son, to lead future generation. They both belonged to the same socioeconomic class. They both struggled and came out as winner from this battle of gold and silver. Her struggles are also bitter and painful. I may write about her struggles in another post some other day.

If one of them falls, it will not return to its previous form.It will either be damaged, bruised, cracked or even scattered.You have to be aware of that and strive for it.Manage your work efficiently during working hours, take the time to be assured of your sincerity, give the necessary time to your family and friends, take appropriate rest, and take care of your health.

Don’t believe it when you hear, “Based on your previous salary, all we can offer you is…” The cost of living in your city has nothing to do with your contribution to the business or compensation for your capabilities.There are excuses like, “You’re not very technical” or “You have experience, just not the right kind of experience” or “You only have a Masters.” If you have been doing the job well for over 3 years, you’ve proven none of that matters.Quality companies and Data Science leaders don’t play any of those games. One of the first things a leader learns is how to get our people paid. If we don’t, we end up surrounded by low performers who can’t get a better job and we don’t last long in a leadership role.Find a company and leadership who values your contributions enough to compensate you. Don’t let anyone talk you into questioning your worth.#datascience #machinelearning"

Motivated to learn more and understand the basics on layer and neuron level, I took the first deep learning specialization course made by Andrew Ng and successfully completed it. Despite being a practicing data scientist with versatile experience of more than two years, I found this course very informative and helpful in clearing all the concepts related to deep learning networks. For me, a major learning from this course was that vectorizing the equations and using matrices rather than iterative loops to calculate weights, costs and differentials had remarkable impact on improving and optimizing the performance of deep learning networks. I'll definitely recommend this course to all AI/ML enthusiasts and practitioners who still view deep learning networks as a black box. Keep learning and keep growing."

And then suddenly when you are about 40 or 45 years old in the middle of life you wake up one day and say, Huh … I've arrived. And by Joe, I feel pretty much the same as I have always felt.

These students, later on, miss a lot of relevant opportunities because the companies had a minimum grade criterion for initial selection.Similarly, I've seen mentors being grade-biased towards student with minimum skills; resulting in high cgpas with average to nill skill sets.",

They do not generally give the buyer the actual artwork or its copyright.Benyamin Ahmed is keeping his earnings in the form of Ethereum - the crypto-currency in which they were sold. This means they could go up or down in value and there is no back-up from the authorities if the digital wallet in which he is holding them is hacked or compromised.Ahmed had made a Minecraft-inspired digital-art collection that consisted of 40 colourful, pixelized avatars called Minecraft Yee Haa, however, it did not sell for a whopping amount. And later he went on for Weird Whales.For creating 3,350 emoji-type whales, Benyamin Ahmed used his own program by using a well-known pixelated whale meme image and a popular digital-art style. #digital #art #artwork #marketing #digitalmarketing #publishing #branding #currency #design #startuppakistan"

I still can't believe I get to be part of this, and that I get to do it for a living.To anyone who is struggling with their passion: I failed several times before finding myself in this spot. I had to take SEVERAL of my game dev classes THREE TIMES because I was too depressed to go, too anxious to return after missing one class, or my ADHD felt like a prison. I went to school for nearly a decade part-time, and I didn't even finish (I think my official GPA is 2.8). Some semesters, I dropped all my classes so I could afford to feed myself. I was laid off from my first dev job four months after being hired full-time, after an entire year on end to end contracts with uncertain ends. I kept trying, anyway!!!!!!!Today, I'm working on a beautiful, historic project with mind-blowingly talented people, my impostor syndrome is NONEXISTENT, and I actually look forward to Mondays.Follow your dreams, work hard, keep going.

The returns an employee can provide knowing it is being paid much more at its current place than he will be anywhere else will not let him leave. Infact, the employee will go beyond his capabilities to justify his presence.Instead of minimizing the middle line and cutting costs, pay the slight brunt of compensating your employees above the market value and see the results in the top-line, and that too for the long-term.#leadership #recruitment #salary"

Among the fresh graduates 80 percent had Data scientist as title.It might come a bit harsh but I want to point this out that just because you have taken a Python subject in university, it does not make you a data scientist.My advice to all the fresh graduates is that if you have interest in data, start with data engineering, which is as important for data analytics as data science itself. You can always switch to data science once you are comfortable with data. I am saying this because 90% of the people fail to clear the interviews.  #datascience #dataengineering #freshgraduates #consulting #dataanalytics #bigdata #python"

The current strong economic and trade ties between the two countries will help foster such agreements, which will bring the two countries closer together, the ambassador said while talking to the media through the 3rd phase of a series of digital ‘Zoom Link’ media talks organised by the embassy of Pakistan in Rome.The ambassador said the Pakistani embassy in Rome is currently working to provide legal assistance to Pakistani migrants, and the ‘Workforce Export Agreement’ between Italy and Pakistan is one such link for creating opportunities for local skilled labour in the Italian market.Jauhar Saleem said Italy and Pakistan have agreed in principle to negotiate a labour agreement that will give Pakistan comprehensive market access to the Italian labour market.#job #opportunities #pakistani #pakistan #final #pact #startuppakistan"

In Pakistan Uber Careem driver Purchase that App for 1000 rs per day from some IT company. In the mocked app they have options to set speed of travelling so Drivers set the speed upto 200 km and start that fake gps app and Minimize it. when they drop customer they dont finish the ride from actual uber app instead they open the cloned app and stop ride since speed is set to 200 km so app shows  5 to 7 consecutives routes from pickup point to destination point in one ride at that time so customer bill raised to 50 to 400 times depends on speed set in the app and driver  give excuses that surged is Applied. Today we travel 14 km and our bill was 2800 rs which should not be more than 650 rs even surged is applied. You seriously look into it otherwise you will soon or later face Legal Consequences."

Keeping in view the growth trend of the last 12 months, Italy could join the so-called ‘Billion Dollar Club/markets for remittances’ for Pakistan, which could help it address its current account gap.Speaking to the business community in Islamabad, the envoy urged Pakistani businessmen and traders to make efforts to promote mutual trade and economic ties between the two nations.“Economic, trade and cultural relations between Italy and Pakistan are at an all-time high,” he said. “Italy hosts the largest number of Pakistani diaspora in the European Union (EU).”Stating figures, he said that workers remittances from Italy hit historic high of $601 million in FY21 and as a result, Italy emerged as the seventh largest global destination for workers remittances to Pakistan and ranked first among the countries in the EU. #business #growth #opportunities #pakistan #dollar #markets #startuppakistan"

Among the fresh graduates 80 percent had Data scientist as title.It might come a bit harsh but I want to point this out that just because you have taken a Python subject in university, it does not make you a data scientist.My advice to all the fresh graduates is that if you have interest in data, start with data engineering, which is as important for data analytics as data science itself. You can always switch to data science once you are comfortable with data. I am saying this because 90% of the people fail to clear the interviews.  #datascience #dataengineering #freshgraduates #consulting #dataanalytics #bigdata #python"

I mean, he clearly didn’t have a clue about Google's potential.He's worth $125bn today. Had he gone ahead with the deal, I doubt he’d be worth more than $50m, and you wouldn’t have heard of Page, Brin, or Google.Most consider a co-founder of Google that was willing to sell it all for $750k as a tech genius, a man with extraordinary vision.He wasn't.Successful CEOs are not superhuman.

I used Neteller as the payment method in Binance. I received the confirmation email from Neteller(NETELLER TEAM, NETELLER Support) in which it was mentioned that my account was undergoing KYC verification and nobody knew other than I and Neteller(NETELLER TEAM, NETELLER Support) and I released the crypto believing in the credibility of the email. When I didn't receive any payment in my Neteller account, I contacted NETELLER Support who said that there was no record of the transaction and that the email was not from Neteller(NETELLER TEAM, NETELLER Support).I was shocked  that how could this happen when no one knew that my account was undergoing KYC verification.

What tossing technique she used? They admire her focus and attitude before each toss, her immense belief in herself.And this, to a large extent, is how successful entrepreneurs are analysed.Take Jobs. After founding Apple he founded NeXT, a failure. Over 12 years he blew US$100's of millions, wasted $100k on the logo, and according to Jobs himself it never even found a product-market fit.Sure, it was bought by Apple but only because Jobs came with it.One of the world's great entrepreneurs couldn't get a business with tons of funding off the ground for over a decade. Yet kids, fresh from university with no business experience, do on shoestring budgets.Business is far more luck than most of us entrepreneurs want to admit. And it explains why many successful entrepreneurs get Imposter's Syndrome - a fear of being 'found out'. That fear isn't misplaced.Hard work is absolutely crucial for success - but most fail despite it.We all seek the method. But in entrepreneurship, the truth is there is far more madness than there is method."

        "text": "#ZeroShot Learning is the ability to detect classes that the model has never seen during training. It resembles our ability as humans to generalize and identify new things without explicit supervision.For example, let’s say we want to do sentiment classification and news category classification. Normally, we will train/fine-tune a new model for each dataset. In contrast, with zero-shot learning, you can perform tasks such as sentiment and news classification directly without any task-specific training.Whereas, #TransferLearning (TL) is a machine learning (ML) technique that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem with a little task specific training at the end nodes. For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks.Blogpost: https://lnkd.in/gnkqDkJCredits: Amit, Philip Vollet#machinelearning #nlp #datascience #deeplearning #neuralnetworks #transformers #tensorflow #python #scikitlearn #datascientists #dataengineering #spark #hadoop #datanalytics #datasciencejobs #advancedanalytics #ml #artificialintelligence"

While this occurrence appears to be new, it actually dates back to 2011, when a group of Japanese researchers came up with the notion of turning mosquitoes, the disease’s super-spreaders, into flying vaccines.When mosquitoes bite, they inject a little drop of saliva into our bloodstream, which prevents it from clotting. That set of scientists injected an antigen — a substance that causes the immune system to respond – into the mix of proteins in their saliva.To generate antibodies, mice have to be bitten at least 1500 times every day on average. Despite this, the researchers were unable to ascertain if the antibodies would be sufficient to prevent infection in a human body.Professor Dr. Muhammad Tabassum Afzal, the Rector of COMSATS University, announced this during a session of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and Technology on Wednesday.The Rector informed the committee that varsity students are conducting research on mosquitoes in order to transform them into vaccine speeders rather than disease carriers. #research #students #university #scienceandtechnology #tech #startuppakistan"

Most senior Data Scientists wouldn’t pass a junior Data Scientists job interview because it has nothing to do with the actual job.2. Qualified candidates are bounced before they make it to the hiring manager because they don’t keyword stuff their resume just the right way.3. Job descriptions contain all the requirements for a Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Machine Learning Engineer and they expect 1 person to cover 3 roles.4. 3+ rounds of interviews…spend enough time looking for flaws and you’ll find them.5. Every new hire requires training and onboarding so looking for the best or perfect candidate is unrealistic.I’m not sure how they expect to hire people when their entire process is built to exclude people. It’s not difficult to fix either. I’ve rebuilt hiring processes in under a month. I’ve hired entire Data Science teams in 6-12 weeks.I am definitely not the smartest person on Earth or the only one who has figured this out. Companies complaining about talent shortages are like a thirsty kid holding an unopened water bottle surrounded by people telling them how to open it.#datascience #machinelearning"

So at SurveyAuto, we decided to map the entire retail landscape of Pakistan. Problem? It required an investment of $1.2 Million. We could invest, but will someone be willing to pay for it? Today, we signed up two of the largest FMCGs in Pakistan to become our anchor clients.  .... so here we go, SurveyAuto is mapping the entire retail landscape of Pakistan!"

It’s not all about technical skills, your behaviour, communication skills also matters Unfortunately i have not reached till final step but it gave me enough confidence to at least give a try to apply at world tech leading companies.
